# Principles-of-Managerial-Statistics-and-Data-Science
Book that introduces students to the basics of statistics and data science. Book is based on over 100 real world open datasets including: assessing if searches during a police stop in San Diego are dependent on driver’s race; visualizing the association between fat percentage and moisture percentage in Canadian cheese; modeling taxi fares in Chicago using data from millions of rides; and analyzing mean sales per unit of legal marijuana products in Washington state. 

In this repository we share R codes used for open data examples and case studies in the book.
