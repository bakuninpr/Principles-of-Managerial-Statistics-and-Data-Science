# Principles-of-Managerial-Statistics-and-Data-Science
Book that introduces students to the basics of statistics and data science. Book is based on over 100 real world open datasets including: assessing if searches during a police stop in San Diego are dependent on driver’s race; visualizing the association between fat percentage and moisture percentage in Canadian cheese; modeling taxi fares in Chicago using data from millions of rides; and analyzing mean sales per unit of legal marijuana products in Washington state. 

In this repository we share R codes used for open data examples and case studies in the book.

While all datasets are open, these datasets may change over time. For the sake of reproducibility, fixed versions of the datasets may be accessed at: https://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=resource&bcsId=11701&itemId=1119486416&resourceId=46838

All R code was fully functional when the book was published but keep in mind that future improvements by R developers or R library developers may result in errors developing. 
R o R Studio for Windows can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ or https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/. 
In case of error while running code, verify your version of R and the packages; changes may have occurred.
