# The open source software R is used to obtain the murder rate in some 
# police districts in LA. 

# R o R Studio for Windows can be downloaded from
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/ or https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/. 
# Note that in addition to the crime data we need demographic 
# data to calculate the murder statistics in Los Angeles.
# This code runs in R 3.3.1 since September 16, 2017.In case of an error, 
# verify your version of the data R, or packages since posible changes might have occured.

# NOTE: Every line that begins with "#" the program detects it as a comment.

# First, the required tools are prepared to work in the case study

# A function will be created to install or load required packages for this application. The provided function is from: https://gist.github.com/stevenworthington/3178163
